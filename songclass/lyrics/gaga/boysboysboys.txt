Hey there sugar baby
Saw you twice at the pop show
You taste just like glitter mixed with rock and roll
I like you a lot lot
Think you're really hot hot

I know you think you're special
When we dance real crazy
Glam-aphonic, electronic, disco baby
I like you a lot lot
All we want is hot hot


Boys boys boys
We like boys in cars
Boys boys boys
Buy us drinks in bars
Boys boys boys
With hairspray and denim
Boys boys boys
We love them!

Oh, oh

Baby is a bad boy
With some retro sneakers
Let's go see The Killers
And make out in the bleachers
I like you a lot lot
Think you're really hot hot
Let's go to the party
Heard our buddy's the DJ
Don't forget my lipstick
I left it in your ashtray
I like you a lot lot
All we want is hot hot



I'm not loose, I like to party
Let's get lost in your Ferrari
Not psychotic or dramatic
I like boys and that is that
Love it when you call me legs
In the morning buy me eggs
Watch your heart when we're together
Boys like you love me forever

Oh, oh, oh, oh



We love them!



(We love them!)
