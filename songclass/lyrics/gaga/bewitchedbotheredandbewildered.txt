After one whole quart of brandy
Like a daisy I'm awake
With no Bromo Seltzer handy
I don't even shake

Men are not a new sensation
I've done pretty well I think
But this half pint imitation
Put me on the blink

But I'm wild again, beguiled again
Simpering, whimpering child again
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered, am I

I could not sleep and wouldn't sleep
Till love came and told me I shouldn't sleep
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered, am I

Oh I lost my heart, but what of it?
He is cold I agree
They can laugh, but I love him
And so the laugh's on me

I'll sing to him, bring spring to him
And long for the day when I cling to him
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered, am I

He's a fool and don't I know it
But a fool can have his charms
I'm in love and don't I show it
Like a babe in arms

Oh!
I've sinned a lot, I mean a lot
But now I'm sweet seventeen a lot
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered, am I
Bewitched! Bothered! And bewildered, am I
