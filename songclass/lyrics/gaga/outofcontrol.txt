Hey babe,
I'm feelin' something kinda crazy.
I know that we got something special, boy.
But lately I've been feelin' naughtier 
than usual.

You see I 


I need a love that's crazy don't you see?
I'm looking for someone who can handle me.
Need a fire so hot that it burns me so.
I'm sorry when I met you that I did not know.
You and me were kind of in complete.
Need someone to say he loveth me.

Give it up
Put it up
Not enough
Not enough
Not enough
I need it 
Out of control


Give it up just let your body
out of control
