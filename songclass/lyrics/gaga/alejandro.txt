I know that we are young
And I know that you may love me
But I just can't be with you like this anymore
Alejandro

She's got both hands
In her pocket
And she won't look at you (won't look at you)
She hides true love
En su bolsillo
She's got a halo around her finger
Around you

You know that I love you boy
Hot like Mexico
Rejoice
At this point I've gotta choose
Nothing to lose

Don't call my name
Don't call my name
Alejandro
I'm not your babe
I'm not your babe
Fernando
Don't wanna kiss
Don't wanna touch
Just smoke my cigarette, hush
Don't call my name
Don't call my name
Roberto

Stop
Please, just let me go
Alejandro
Just let me go

She's not broken
She's just a baby
But her boyfriend's like her dad
Just like a dad
And all those flames that
Burned before him
Now he's gotta firefight
Gotta cool the bad

You know that I love you boy
Hot like Mexico
Rejoice
At this point I've gotta choose
Nothing to lose

Don't call my name
Don't call my name
Alejandro
I'm not your babe
I'm not your babe
Fernando
Don't wanna kiss
Don't wanna touch
Just smoke my cigarette, hush
Don't call my name
Don't call my name
Roberto

Don't bother me
Don't bother me
Alejandro
Don't call my name
Don't call my name
Bye, Fernando
I'm not your babe
I'm not your babe
Alejandro
Don't wanna kiss
Don't wanna touch
Fernando

Don't call my name
Don't call my name
Alejandro
I'm not your babe
I'm not your babe
Fernando
Don't wanna kiss
Don't wanna touch
Just smoke my cigarette, hush
Don't call my name
Don't call my name
Roberto

Don't wanna kiss
Don't wanna touch
Just smoke my cigarette, hush
Don't call my name
Don't call my name
