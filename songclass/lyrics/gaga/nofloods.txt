I never ever thought I'd live away 
From everyone I love and say goodbye 
Now I'm the princess of a downtown train 
Where everybody here, they know my game 
But when I walk down the street I hear them say 
&quot;there she goes, that crazy girl 
She thinks she's something in this world&quot; 

So I'mma close my ears and dream 
'cause life is never really what it seems 
In every mystery, there's a truth 
You know I'm tellin', I'm tellin' you...

No matter lightning or thunder, 
Buckets of rainwater 
You can't flood this town 

In a world unknown 
You've gotta hold your own 
You can't stop me 
You're never ever gonna stop me now 

On every street there is a memory, 
A time and place where we can never be again 
Street lights glow red, green, and yellow too 
Do you let signs tell you what to do? 
Yeah, when you say stop, 
Be sure that I'll say go 
To the stars in the land 

Fire can't burn these hands 
But I just close my eyes and dream 
You cant deny me my astronomy 

In every mystery, there's a truth 
You know I'm tellin', I'm tellin' you...oh..

No matter lightning or thunder, 
Buckets of rainwater 
You can't flood this town 

In a world unknown 
You've gotta hold your own 
And you can't stop me 
You're never ever ever gonna stop me now 

Go ahead and don't believe 
'cause everyone needs a way to breathe 
And love and dream and you can't stop me 
No you can't stop me 

No matter lightning or thunder, 
Buckets of rainwater 
You can't flood this town 

In a world unknown 
You've gotta hold your own 
And you can't stop me 
You're never ever ever gonna stop

No matter lightning or thunder, 
Buckets of rainwater 
You can't flood this town 

In a world unknown 
You've gotta hold your own
