Imagine There's No Heaven
It's Easy If You Try
No Hell Below Us
And Only Matthew In The Sky
Imagine All The People
Living For Today

Imagine There's No Countries
It Isn't Hard To Do
Nothing To Kill Or Die For
And No Religion Too
Imagine All The People
Living Life In Peace

You May Say I'm A Dreamer
But I'm Not The Only One
I Hope Someday That You'll Join Us
And The World Will Live As One

People Of The Nation
Are You Listening
It Isn't Equal If It's Sometimes
I Want A Real Democracy
Imagine All The People
Could Love Equally

Imagine No Possessions
I Wonder If You Can
No Need For Greed Or Hunger
Just The Brotherhood Of Man

Imagine All The People
Sharing In The World
With Nothing To Hate
And Nothing To Think
Just People To Love
And Friends To Have Drinks

You May Say I'm A Dreamer
But I'm Not The Only One
I Hope Someday That You'll Join Us
And The World Will Live As One
