There he goes
My baby walks so slow
Sexual tic-tac-toe
Yeah, I know we both know
It isn't time
But would you be m-mine
We'll never get too far
Just you, me and the bar
So in a menage a trois sometimes
Would he be m-mine? would he be m-mine?
Would you be m-mine?

Oh baby, lights on
But your mom's not home
I'm sick of laying down alone
With this fever, fever, yeah
I want it all
Now I'm gonna get you alone
Give you a fever, fever yeah

There it goes
You stole my soul and so
'cause, sweetheart
A-no-no-nobody a-no-no-knows
They're occupied
Tell me you'll be mine
Let's get inside your car
Just you, me and the stars
Kind of menage a trois sometimes
Would he be m-mine? would he be m-mine?
Could you be mine?
Yeah!

Oh baby, lights on
But your mom's not home
I'm sick of laying down alone 
With this fever, fever, yeah
I want it all
Now I'm gonna get you alone 
Give you a fever, fever, yeah

Yeah, yeah, yeah 
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah

Oh baby, your lights on
But your mom's not home
I'm sick of laying down alone 
With this fever , fever, yeah
I want it all
Now I'm gonna get you alone 
Give you a fever, fever, yeah

Fever, fever, yeah
