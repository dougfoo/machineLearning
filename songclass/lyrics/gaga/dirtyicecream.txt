It's too much a mess 
And a stress to figure out
And too much pressure on us, babe
Last night you took me to the mall
And then it started to get physical

But we've only been on one date, baby
Yeah, and it was fun 'til you start acting crazy
I don't really find it very cute or sexy
When you call or incessantly t-t-text me

Don't be dirty ice cream, baby
We could fall in love but
It's too early to be calling me like that
Stop calling, stop calling
It's not indecision, just my female intuition
Telling me you can't be calling me like that
Stop calling, stop calling

I can't live with you, yeah it's true
Or live without the kind of guy that I'm about
You kiss me like a rockstar and
You always wanna hold my hand

But we've only been on one date, baby
Yeah, and it was fun 'til you start acting crazy
I don't really find it very cute or sexy
When you call or incessantly t-t-text me

Don't be dirty ice cream, baby
We could fall in love but
It's too early to be calling me like that
Stop calling, stop calling
It's not indecision, just my female intuition
Telling me you can't be calling me like that
Stop calling, stop calling

Don't be, don't be (dirty ice cream) 
Don't be, don't be (oh no)

Don't be, don't be (oh no) 
Don't be, don't be 

Don't be dirty ice cream, baby
We could fall in love but
It's too early to be calling me like that
Stop calling, stop calling
It's not indecision, just my female intuition
Telling me you can't be calling me like that
Stop calling, stop calling
