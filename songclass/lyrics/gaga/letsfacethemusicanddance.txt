There may be trouble ahead
But while there's moonlight and music and love and romance
Let's face the music and dance

Before the fiddlers have fled
Before they ask us to pay the bill
And while we still have the chance
Let's face the music and dance

Soon, we'll be without the moon
Humming a different tune
And then...

There may be teardrops to shed
So while there's moonlight and music and love and romance
Let's face the music and dance

Soon, we'll be without the moon
Humming a different tune
And then...
And then...

There may be teardrops to shed
So while there's moonlight and music and love and romance
Let's face the music and dance
Dance
Let's face the music and dance
