It's been a long time since I came around
Been a long time but I'm back in town
This time I'm not leaving without you
You taste like whiskey when you kiss me, oh
I’d give anything again to be your baby doll
This time I'm not leaving without you

He said, sit back down where you belong
In the corner of my bar with your high heels on
Sit back down on the couch where we made love the first time
And you said to me

Somethin', somethin' about this place
Somethin', 'bout lonely nights and my lipstick on your face
Somethin', somethin' about my cool Nebraska guy
Yeah something about, baby, you and I

It's been two years since I let you go
I couldn't listen to a joke or rock 'n' roll
Muscle cars drove a truck right through my heart
On my birthday you sang me &quot;A Heart Of Gold&quot;
With a guitar hummin' and no clothes
This time I'm not leaving without you
Ooh-oh ooh-oh

Sit back down where you belong
In the corner of my bar with your high heels on
Sit back down on the couch where we made love the first time
And you said to me

Somethin', somethin' about this place
Somethin', 'bout lonely nights and my lipstick on your face
Somethin', somethin' about my cool Nebraska guy
Yeah something about, baby, you and I

You and I, you, you and I
You, you and I, you, you and I

You and I, you, you and I
Oh, yeah, I'd rather die
Without you and I

C'mon!
Put your drinks up!

We got a whole lot of money but we still pay rent
'Cause you can't buy a house in heaven
There's only three men that I'mma serve my whole life
It's my daddy and Nebraska and Jesus Christ

Somethin', somethin' about the chase (six whole years)
I'm a New York woman born to run you down
Still want my lipstick all over your face
Somethin', somethin' about just knowing when it's right
So put your drinks up for Nebraska,
For Nebraska, Nebraska, I love ya

You and I, you, you and I
Baby I rather die
Without you and I

You and I, you, you and I
Nebraska, I'd rather die,
Without you and I

It's been a long time since I came around
Been a long time but I'm back in town
And this time I'm not leaving without you
