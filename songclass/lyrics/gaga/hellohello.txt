Feel a feeling light
Headed out to see the sights
Ain't life a many splendored thing?


Ducking up and down
All these crazy sights and sounds
Bounce around like puppets on a string
Never gonna find, anything to change my mind
Famous last lines of a fool


Just when you think
You're a chain with just one link
Something comes to tip you off your stool


Hello, hello
Hello, hello
My, my, my, what have we here?
What a surprise
What a surprise!


Hello, hello
Hello, hello
I'm not alone it's good to know
Someone's out there to say hello
Hello!


Do a dizzy dance
Twirl around and take a chance
Nothing's easy
Nothing comes for free

Sniffing on a flower
Running through an autumn shower
Bumping into someone else like me


Hello, hello
Hello, hello
My, my, my, what have we here?
What a surprise
What a surprise!


Hello, hello
Hello, hello
I'm not alone it's good to know
Someone's out there to say hello
Hello!


And I can fly on the back of a bird
And I can shake all leaves from a tree
If there's a quest of a knight
Where's there's wrong I'll do right
Do this better than the one I used to be


Hello, hello
Hello, hello
My, my, my, what have we here?
What a surprise
What a surprise!


Hello, hello
Hello, hello
I'm not alone it's good to know
Someone's out there to say hello


Hello, hello
Hello, hello
