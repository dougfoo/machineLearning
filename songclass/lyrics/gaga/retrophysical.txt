(we gonna grab them highs and get 'em off the wall)
(so everybody in here can start smokin')

Yeah
Uh-huh

(we gonna grab them highs and get 'em off the wall)
(so everybody in here can start smokin')

Lets get into trouble
Lots of trouble
Rock star
You know how to rock hard
Hello midnight lover-lover
Hold that lady tighter
Shoot that bullet through her

My heart beats just like a cherry soda
In the summer
Go, go, go
Don't be difficult about it
Get off it

Off the walls (get your ass)
Off the walls (do that girl)
Don't stumble
Retro physical
Off the walls (get your ass)
Off the walls (move that boy)
So sexual
Retro physical
