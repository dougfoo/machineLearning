I love that lavender blonde
The way she moves
The way she walks
I touch myself can't get enough
And in the silence of the night
Through all the tears
And all the lies
I touch myself and it's alright

Just give in
Don't give up baby
Open up your heart and your mind to me

Just know when
That glass is empty
That the world is gonna bend

Happy in the club with a bottle of red wine
Stars in our eyes 'cuz we're having a good time

Eh-eh
Eh-eh
So happy I could die
Be your best friend
Yeah I'll love you forever
Up in the clouds
We'll be higher than ever

Eh-eh
Eh-eh
So happy I could die
And it's alright

Aha-aha

I am as vain as I allow
I do my hair
I gloss my eyes
I touch myself all through the night
And when something falls out of place
I take my time
I put it back
I touch myself
Till I'm on track

Just give in
Don't give up baby
Open up your heart and your mind to me

Just know when
That glass is empty
That the world is gonna bend

Happy in the club with a bottle of red wine
Stars in our eyes 'cuz we're having a good time

So happy I could die
Be your best friend
Yeah I'll love you forever
Up in the clouds
We'll be higher than ever

So happy I could die
And it's alright

So happy I could die

Happy in the club with a bottle of red wine

So happy I could die
Be your best friend
Yeah I'll love you forever
Up in the clouds
We'll be higher than ever

So happy I could die
And it's alright
