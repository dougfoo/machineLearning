Red One
Konvict
Gaga (oh, yeah)

I've had a little bit too much, much
All of the people start to rush.
Start to rush by.
A dizzy twister dance
Can't find my drink or man.
Where are my keys? I lost my phone, phone.

What's going on, on the floor?
I love this record, baby, but I can't see straight anymore.
Keep it cool, what's the name of this club?
I can't remember but it's alright, a-alright.


Just dance. Gonna be okay.
Da-doo-doo-doo
Just dance. Spin that record babe.
Da-doo-doo-doo
Just dance. Gonna be okay.
Duh-duh-duh-duh
Dance. Dance. Dance. Just dance.

Wish I could shut my playboy mouth.
How'd I turn my shirt inside out, inside out right?
Control your poison, babe
&quot;Roses have thorns,&quot; they say.
And we're all gettin' hosed tonight.

What's going on, on the floor?
I love this record, baby, but I can't see straight anymore.
Keep it cool, what's the name of this club?
I can't remember but it's alright, a-alright.




When I come through on the dance floor checking out that catalogue.
Can't believe my eyes so many women without a flaw.
And I ain't gonna' give it up, steady tryna pick it up like a car
I'ma hit it, I'ma hit it and latch onto it until tomorrow, yeah
Shorty I can see that you got so much energy
The way you twirling up them hips 'round and 'round
And there is no reason at all why you can't leave here with me
In the mean time stay, let me watch you break it down.



Half psychotic, sick hypnotic got my blueprint it's symphonic.
Half psychotic, sick hypnotic got my blueprint electronic.
Half psychotic, sick hypnotic got my blueprint it's symphonic.
Half psychotic, sick hypnotic got my blueprint electronic.

Go. Use your muscle, carve it out, work it, hustle
I got it, just stay close enough to get it
Don't slow! Drive it, clean it, Lysol, bleed it
Spend the last dough
(I got it)
In your pocko
(I got it)
