I know where you were last night
I saw you with your hands on her
Rubbing her like you love her more than me
And I cannot believe
What's she got that I don't know
How you could pass up a night with me
To drive 'round homegirl
When I got her body you can feel
Boy, she's not even real
Don't lie to me 'cause

I don't understand it
Why you always with your freakin' car (your freakin car, freakin' car)
I cannot believe it
You'd rather be with your freakin' car (your freakin' car, freakin' car)

You stayed home to repaint her
When I could use a hot wax, personal manicure
I need attention too
So you might have to choose
'Cause I can't take it
When I know that I'm more fine
And I got the interior love and it's genuine
My trunk is just as round and I'll never break down
Babe, it's not fair that

I don't understand it
Why you always with your freakin' car (your freakin car, freakin' car)
I cannot believe it
You'd rather be with your freakin' car (your freakin' car, freakin' car)

I don't understand it
Why you always with your freakin' car (your freakin car, freakin' car)
I cannot believe it
You'd rather be with your freakin' car (your freakin' car, freakin' car)
