the prisoner meets the muppet hi-fi
north of watford junction
we get in but we don't have fun
an' we leave before the truncheons
so it's back to watch the day to day
saga of working people
hanging out the washing and clipping coupons
and generally being decent

johnny too bad meets johnny be good
in the charing cross road
that's the only thing that happened today
says the west end jungle code
and all the germans and all the french
jam themselves down the tube
and re-enact the second world war
while the rude boys get rude!

and i look to my left
and i look to my right
and i'm looking for a man
i'm looking for a sign
i don't wanna be the prisoner

the prisoner lives in camden town
selling revolution
the prisoner loads his tracking arm up
with self-disillusion
your mother does the washing up
your old man digs the garden
you're only free to dodge the cops
an' bunk the train to stardom
