Nowhere 
Yeah we're going nowhere fast
Maybe this time, ill be yours you'll be mine
c-c-c-crazy, get your ass in my bed
Baby you'll be, just my summer boyfriend 
Summer boy

Lets get lost you can take me home
Somewhere nice we can be alone
Bikini tops, coming o-o-off
Don't be sad when the sun goes down
You'll wake up and im not around
Ive got to go oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
We'll still have the summer after all

Sometimes, you might start a fight
But Im happy pretending we're alright (alright)
Sun glasses, cover up my green eyes
My martini glistens, yeah
While checking out other guys
Summer boy

Lets get lost you can take me home
Somewhere nice we can be alone
Bikini tops, coming o-o-off
Don't be sad when the sun goes down
You'll wake up and Im not around
Ive got to go oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
We'll still have the summer after all

Hey there summer boy
Lets go for a drive
Take me for a ride
Never gonna close our eyes

Hey there summer boy
Im a busy girl
Don't got too much time
Hurry up before I change my mind

Hey there summer boy
Im taking off my heels
Lets go for a run
Have a little summer fun
Have a little summer fun
Summer boy

Lets get lost you can take me home
Somewhere nice we can be alone
Bikini tops, popping o-o-off
Don't be sad when the sun goes down
You'll wake up and Im not around
You've got to go oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
We'll still have the summer after 

Lets get lost you can take me home
Somewhere nice we can be alone
You'll be my summer-summer boy

Don't be sad when the sun goes down
You'll wake up and Im not around
You'll be my summer-summer boy

And we'll still have the summer after all

I've got my-
Yes I've got my-
I've got my summer-summer boy
