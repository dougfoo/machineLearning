And I hear you say a Clash a you ruler
Say a Clash sound cooler, eh!

And now-a-days man a measure mile in a metre, eh!

A-and a so me say fe live up to your name

Some a dem a bodysnatcher
Some a dem a barracuda, eh!
But who a know fe me Jah Jah

A-and I say me say dat some a dem a Sex Pistol

A none a dem deh measure gallon in a litre
And I tell you say me know dem a cheat ya

'Cause when you living inna fame
You got to live up to your name
Or else a suffer and you die inna shame
And I tell you say it's all in the game, eh!
