In olden days a glimpse of stocking
Was looked on as something shocking
Now heaven knows, anything goes


Good authors too who once knew better words
Now only use four letter words writing prose
Anything goes


The world has gone mad today
And good's bad today


And day's night today
And black's white today


When most guys today that women prize today


Are just silly gigolos


And though I'm not a great romancer


I know you're bound to answer


When we propose, anything goes


GO!


GO!


The world has gone mad today


And good's bad today


And day's night today


And black's white today


When most guys today that women prize today
Are just silly gigolos


And though we're not such great romancers
We know that you're bound to answer
When we propose, anything goes


Anything goes


Anything goes


Anything goes
