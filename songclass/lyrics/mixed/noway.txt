I saw a shadow, and I knew that it wasn't mine
You and her, I know that you were intertwined
Even though, her clothes were on and everything
Your eyes were somewhere else and you were both to blame

Don't say a word, I'm sure that it won't be enough
To erase what I know just happens, now what dreams are made of?
This is my house and I won't allow the disrespect
Baby don't look at me like that I don't belong to you, anyway

'Cause baby now that you're caught what am I supposed to say?
When you're so wrong in what you did but I still feel this way
And I can't believe it, or forget it, what I saw today
And if you're wondering if I'm staying the answer is no way!
No Way! (I can't believe it)
No Way! (I can't believe it babe)
No Way!

Thought that I saw, something I know did not belong to me
But then I thought that there's no way you would do that to me
And then last week, when you went outside to use your phone
I felt a chill but told myself that it was from the cold

And I just woke up, but I wish that it was a nightmare
'Cause I now have those, it isn't real like this one is
This is my heart and I won't allow the disrespect
Baby don't look at me like that, I don't belong to you, anyway

'Cause baby now that you're caught what am I supposed to say?
When you're so wrong in what you did but I still feel this way
And I can't believe it, or forget it, what I saw today
And if you're wondering if I'm staying the answer is no way!
No Way! (I can't believe it)
No Way! (I can't believe it babe)
No Way!

Get your things and go...
You can take the dinner left over from last night
I made you your favorite. Goodbye

'Cause baby now that you're caught what am I supposed to say?
When you're so wrong in what you did but I still feel this way
And I can't believe it, or forget it, what I saw today
And if you're wondering if I'm staying the answer is no way!
No Way! (I can't believe it)
No Way! (I can't believe it babe)
No Way!
