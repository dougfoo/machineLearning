Listen
I've got the sickest ambition
Deep in the mirror I am scared
Don't know who the hell is there
Yeah, I'm losing my reflection

Obsession
You'd think it's our new religion
Each model and celebrity
Changes how I look at me
Oh don't tell me, don't tell me I'll never be

A superstar 'cause I know I could look
Like a girl in Hollywoo-hood
Hollywoo-hood, Hollywoo-hood
Hollywoo-hood, Hollywoo-hood

Women
Let's talk about our condition
Now beauty's a commodity
Nip and tuck your fantasy
But you better live with your revision

I have a vision
It's a world without the incisions
Sure Hollywood's commercially
Glamorous but naturally's
The way to be and you can't tell me I'm not sexy

Like a superstar 'cause I know I could look
Like a girl in Hollywoo-hood
Hollywoo-hood, Hollywoo-hood
Hollywoo-hood, Hollywoo-hood

Woo-hood, Hollywoo-hood
Hollywoo-hood

Oh, within a year I know I could
Oh, look like a girl in Hollywood
Oh, a superstar, yeah I know I could
Look like a girl in Hollywoo-hood

Hollywood, Hollywoo-hood
Hollywoo-hood, Hollywoo-hood
Hollywoo-hood

Woo-hood, Hollywoo-hood
Hollywoo-hood, yeah
