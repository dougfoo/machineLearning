Blueberry kisses, my lips they miss his, oh yeah
Where did you go now? Where did you go?
Blueberry kisses

I told you baby, I'd love you maybe
But you stopped the clock the second time around

I need you around (blueberry kisses)
I need you around (blueberry kisses)
I need you around (blueberry kisses)

Blueberry kisses, the muffin man
He misses them kisses, yeah
Where did they go now? Where did you go?
Blueberry kisses

I told you baby, I'd l-o-v-e you maybe,
But you stopped the clock the second time around

You know it's crazy, but I've been feeling lately
That I need you around

I need you around (blueberry kisses)
I need you around (blueberry kisses)
I need you around (blueberry kisses)
