Now every cheap hood strikes a bargain with the world
Ends up making payments on a sofa or a girl
Love 'n hate tattooed across the knuckles of his hands
Hands that slap his kids around, 'cause they don't understand how

Death or glory, becomes just another story
Death or glory, becomes just another story

'N every gimmick hungry yob digging gold from rock 'n roll
Grabs the mic to tell us he'll die before he's sold
But I believe in this and it's been tested by research
He, who fucks nuns, will later join the church

Death or glory, becomes just another story
Death or glory, becomes just another story

Fear in the gun-sights
They say lie low
You say ok
Don't wanna play the show
Now all you're thinking
&quot;Was it death or glory now?&quot;
Playing the blues of kings
Sure looks better now

Death or glory, just another story?
Death or glory, just another story?

From every dingy basement, on every dingy street
Every dragging handclap over every dragging beat
It's just the beat of time, the beat that must go on
If you've been trying for years, we 'ready heard your song

Death or glory, becomes just another story
Death or glory, just another story?

We gonna march, a long way
Fight, a long time
We got to travel, over mountains
Got to travel, over seas
We gonna fight, your brother
We gonna fight, 'til you lose
We gonna raise, trouble
We gonna raise, hell

We gonna fight, your brother
Raise, hell

Death or glory, becomes just another story
Death or glory, becomes just another story

Death or glory, just another story?
Death or glory, becomes just another story
