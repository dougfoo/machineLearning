Baby, I put you in my show
That I see a serial killer (outside, banging outside)
Gangsta and some dangerous people
That you talk when you get back

Get back and get and put ass off
Lil monster let jump paws up

Scream Loud
Scream Loud honest eyes
Playing cards and barbies when I was young
So baby Scream out Loud
Scream-Screa-Scream-Scream-Screa-Scream Loud
Cover me with your tender love with care
Your not scary but you looks like ugly
So take a mess
Don't wait for nothin
Scream-Screa-Scream-Scream-Screa-Scream Loud

Don't go outside because you are not ready to kill
Bonding with your family
Hanging out with your friends
Honey you is liar
Because you fall in line

Get back and get and put ass off
Lil monster let jump paws up

Oh-Oh-Oh-Oh
I can't believed that I will pass it
I suppose to be a lower
Got to call my lawyer
Put me in jail
I will be a Bandit and be your blinds is me

Scream out loud that if naughty
Scream out loud when you want party

Scream Loud
Scream Loud honest eyes
Playing cards and barbies when I was young
So baby Scream out Loud
Scream-Screa-Scream-Scream-Screa-Scream Loud
Cover me with your tender love with care
Your not scary but you looks like ugly
So take a mess
Don't wait for nothin
Scream-Screa-Scream-Scream-Screa-Scream Loud

Oh-Oh-Oh-Oh
I can't believed that I will pass it
I suppose to be a lower
Got to call my lawyer
Put me in jail
I will be a Bandit and be your blinds is me
Scream out loud that if naughty
Scream out loud when you want party

Be apart of my history
Be apart of my success
Scream Loud
Scream Loud
Cover up our payment
Cover me of your embrace

Playing cards and barbies when I was young
So baby Scream out Loud
Scream-Screa-Scream-Scream-Screa-Scream Loud
Cover me with your tender love with care
Your not scary but you looks like ugly
So take a mess
Don't wait for nothin'
