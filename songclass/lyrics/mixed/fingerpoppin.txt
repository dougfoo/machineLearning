This here finger of mine
Is gonna point to the beat, right on time
This finger points in a brand new dance
This finger points for a new romance

This here finger's got no ring
It'll point at anything
This finger points gonna pop tonight
Gonna point at the best girl in sight

Don't talk shop
Fingerpop
Don't talk shop
Fingerpop

Girls, girls round the floor
Are you wondering what you came for
Why do these boys stand in groups
Are they urban tribes of fighting troops

Girls, girls it's time to act
Time to beat gonna make contact
Make it plain and make it clear
Just point out who you want to hear

Don't talk shop
Round the house
Fingerpop

Dont' talk shop
(???)
Man or mouse

Don't talk shop
Fingerpop
Don't talk shop
Fingerpop

Boys, boys cat got your tongue
Can't you see she's the prettiest one
Better act real hurt
Just turn around kickin' the dirt

This here (???) is on selling street
Tell the girl who you want to meet
This here finger gonna point tonight
Gonna point at the best girl in sight

Gonna move
Gonna move
Gonna move
Gonna move

Girls, girls go around the floor
Can't remember what you came here for

Don't talk shop
Fingerpop
Don't talk shop
Fingerpop

This here finger of mine
Gonna point to the beat, right on time
This finger points in a brand new dance
This finger points for a new romance

This here finger's got no ring
And it gets to point at anything
This finger points rock tonight
Gonna point at the best girl in sight
