I call her Firefly
Cause, oh, my
She radiates moonglow
Wants none of that noon glow
She starts to glitter
When the sun goes down

Bout eight p.m., it's mayhem
She switches the brights up
Lights up and gives me a call
Take me to the Fireflies ball

But when I get her there
Set her there
Do I get to pet her there
And grab me some glow

No, she's a gad about, mad about
Luring every lad about
While leaving me moaning low

Oh, Firefly, why can't I
Latch onto you no how
Oh, how I love you but gee
While you set the night on
Firefly, shine a little light on me

But when I get her there
Set her there
Do I get to pet her there
And grab me some glow

No, she's a gad about, mad about
Luring every lad about
While leaving me moaning low

Oh, Firefly, why can't I
Latch on for you no how
Oh, how I love you but gee
While you set the night on
Firefly, shine a little light on
Shine a little light on
Shine a little light on me
(in the mornin')
