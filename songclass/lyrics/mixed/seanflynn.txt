You know he just heard
The drums of war
when the past
Was a closing door

The drums beat into the jungle floor


Closing door
Closing door

Rain on the leaves
soldier sing
You never hear anything

They filled the sky with a tropical storm.



You know he head the drums of war
Each man knows what he's looking for
