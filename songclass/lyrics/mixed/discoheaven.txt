Oh, the disco heaven
Oh, the disco heaven

Get back, bunny
It's getting cold in here little honey
We got a show to put on your dress
Take a minute for us and relax, relax
Cupid's got me, oh with his bow &amp; arrow, baby
He'll hit you in the pants, hot pants
Get the people to dance and relax, relax

Oh the lights still on, we're dancing
Yeah the floor is shaking
In this disco heaven
(Oh, the disco heaven)
The disco heaven

(Oh, the disco heaven)

Oh the lights still on, we're dancing
Yeah the floor is shaking
In this disco heaven
(Oh, the disco heaven)
The disco heaven

(Oh, the disco heaven)

Throw your head back, girly
Throw it like those girls in the movies
We got a show to put on your dress
Take a minute for us and relax, relax

The ball is turning, 300 mirrors burning
Through the hearts of the crowd
In the back hips just banging the track
To the music, the music

Oh the lights still on, we're dancing
Yeah the floor is shaking
In this disco heaven
(Oh, the disco heaven)
The disco heaven

(Oh, the disco heaven)

Oh the lights still on, we're dancing
Yeah the floor is shaking
In this disco heaven
(Oh, the disco heaven)
The disco heaven

(Oh, the disco heaven)

Oh we got that disco
D-I-S-C-O
And we're in heaven
H-E-A-V-E-N
Disco heaven

Feels just like heaven
Disco heaven
Disco heaven

A line up for the dance
Yeah bring those fancy pants
Y'know there's disco in the air
And hairspray everywhere

A disco heaven
A disco heaven
Disco heaven
Disco heaven

Oh the lights still on, we're dancing
Yeah the floor is shaking
In this disco heaven
(Oh, the disco heaven)
The disco heaven

(Oh, the disco heaven)

Oh the lights still on, we're dancing
Yeah the floor is shaking
In this disco heaven
(Oh, the disco heaven)
The disco heaven

(Oh, the disco heaven)
