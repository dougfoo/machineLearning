Do you feel, like you ever want
To try my love and see how well it fits
Baby can't you see, when you look at me
I can't kick this feeling when it hits
Oh all alone, in my bed at night
I grab my pillow and squeeze it tight
I think of you and I dream of you, all of the time
What am I gonna do?

I want your love, I want your love (want your love, you know I need your love)
I want your love, I want your love (want your love, you know I need your love)

I need your love, I need your love
I need your love, I need your love
I need your love, I need your love

I'll share my dreams
And make you see
How really bad your love I need
I want your love, I need your love
Just like the birds in the sky above
I'll share my dreams
And make you see
How really bad your love I need
I'll share my dreams
And make you see
How really bad your love I need

I want your love, I want your love (want your love, you know I need your love)
I want your love, I want your love (want your love, you know I need your love)
I want your love, I want your love (want your love, you know I need your love)
I want your love, I want your love (want your love, you know I need your love)

I want your love
Have you ever been in love
I want your love
You know I want your love
You know I need your love
You know I want your love
You know I need your love
You know I want your love
You know I need your love
You know I want your love
You know I need your love
You know I want your love
You know I want your love
I want your love, I want your love
