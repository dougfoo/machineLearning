She gets too hungry for dinner at 8


(I'm starving)


She loves the theater but she never comes late


I never bother with people that I hate
That's why this chick is a tramp


She doesn't like crap games with barons and earls


Won't go to Harlem in ermine and pearls
And I definitely won't dish our dirt with the rest of those girls


That's why the lady is a tramp


I love the free fresh wind in my hair


Life without care


Oh, I'm so broke,


It's OK


I hate California. It's crowded and damp


That's why the lady is a tramp


I'm a tramp!

Sometimes I go to Coney Island


Oh, the beach is divine


I love the Yankees


Jeter is just fine


I follow Rogers and Hart


She sings every line


That's why the lady is a tramp


I love the prize fight


That isn't a fake


No fakes

And I love to rowboat with you and your wife in Central Park Lake


She goes to the opera and stays wide awake


Yes I do

That's why this lady is a tramp


She likes the green (green) grass (grass) under her shoes


What can I lose? 'cause I got no dough (Oh no?)
I'm all alone when I lower my lamp


That's why the lady is a tramp
Go


I love your free, fresh, I love your handkerchief in my hair


Life without care


But I'm so broke!


That's OK!

Hates California, it's cold and it's damp


That's why the lady is a tramp
That's why this lady is a tramp!


That's why the lady is a tramp
