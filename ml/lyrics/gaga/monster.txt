Don't call me GaGa
I've never seen one like that before
Don't look at me like that
You amaze me

He ate my heart
He a-a-ate my heart
(You little monster)

He ate my heart
He a-a-ate my heart out
(You amaze me)

He ate my heart
He a-a-ate my heart
He ate my heart
He a-a-ate my heart out

Look at him
Look at me
That boy is bad
And honestly
He's a wolf in disguise
But I can't stop staring in those evil eyes

I asked my girlfriend if she'd seen you round before
She mumbled something while we got down on the floor baby
We might've fucked not really sure, don't quite recall
But something tells me that I've seen him, yeah

That boy is a monster
M-m-m-monster
That boy is a monster
M-m-m-monster
That boy is a monster
Er-er-er-er

He ate my heart
(I love that girl)
He ate my heart
(Wanna talk to her, she's hot as hell)

He ate my heart
(I love that girl)
He ate my heart
(Wanna talk to her, she's hot as hell)

He licked his lips
Said to me, &quot;Girl you look good enough to eat.&quot;
Put his arms around me
Said, &quot;Boy now get your paws right off me.&quot;

(Wanna talk to her, she's hot as hell)

He ate my heart
(I love that girl)
He ate my heart
(Wanna talk to her, she's hot as hell)

He ate my heart
He ate my heart
Instead he's a monster in my bed

He ate my heart
He ate my heart
Instead he's a monster in my bed

I wanna just dance
But he took me home instead
There was a monster in my bed
We French-kissed on a subway train
He tore my clothes right off
He ate my heart and then he ate my brain

(I love that girl)
(Wanna talk to her, she's hot as hell)

He ate my heart
He ate my heart
He ate my heart
(Wanna talk to her, she's hot as hell)

That boy is a monster
M-m-m-monster
(Could I love him?)

That boy is a monster
Er-er-er-er
