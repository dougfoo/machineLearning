Nod if you wanna be high with the enemy
It's a test of your stamina, do your best
Nod if you wanna make love with the enemy
Roll it up, baby, smoke it up 'til we're high


Tell my mama it's bad karma, I just killed a man
Tell your honor he got to pardon me if I hide my hand
Fuck what you heard, this shit is revolutionary
Fuck what you heard, this is the last illusion, bury
Me with the nerve and ninety-five marksmen
So I can shoot this game until my trigger finger jam
I see red flag, I see blue flag
I pick a color, then make sure I don't give you a pass
You call it gang violence, you call it livin' mad
I called it life, but now I'm like, 'I fuckin' hate it bad'
And so we holler, 'Fuck what you heard
See, we been down for too long
Fuck what you heard, we been tired of doin' wrong
If you got the nerve to man up and kill a man
Then man up double time and shake that adversary's hand, bang


Nod if you wanna be high with the enemy
It's a test of your stamina, do your best
Nod if you wanna make love with the enemy
Roll it up, baby, smoke it up 'til we're high


Ah, this for the hatred in you
This is for that place of darkness they have placed into you
This is for the early coffins of those discriminated
Or racially profiled, I can look you in the eye
And make a vow that I'll never make another assumption
That you'll never be nothin' to me, he fin' if you did the opposite
I'll still run with pleasure
Doin' you the favour of cuttin' through the evil
Kendrick Lamar like God-lover of all people, bang


Prepare, I descend from the East, my name is Lady Gaga
We partynauseous cause moi seem to have some problem with ya
Prepare, I descend from the West, my name is Kendrick Lamar
We party nauseous cause moi seem to have some problem with ya

Nod if you wanna be high with the enemy
It's a test of your stamina, do your best
Nod if you wanna make love with the enemy
Roll it up, baby, smoke it up 'til we're high
