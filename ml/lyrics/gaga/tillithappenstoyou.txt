You tell me it gets better, it gets better in time
You say I'll pull myself together, pull it together, you'll be fine
Tell me, what the hell do you know? What do you know?
Tell me how the hell could you know? How could you know?

Till it happens to you, you don't know how it feels, how it feels
Till it happens to you, you won't know, it won't be real
No, it won't be real, won't know how it feels

You tell me hold your head up, hold your head up and be strong
'Cause when you fall you gotta get up, you gotta get up and move on
Tell me how the hell could you talk, how could you talk?
'Cause until you walk where I walk, this is no joke

Till it happens to you, you don't know how it feels, how it feels
Till it happens to you, you won't know, it won't be real
(how could you know?)
No it won't be real
(how could you know?)
Won't know how I feel

Till your world burns and crashes
Till you're at the end, the end of your rope
Till you're standing in my shoes
I don't wanna hear a thing from you, from you, from you
'Cause you don't know

Till it happens to you, you don't know how I feel, how I feel
How I feel
Till it happens to you, you won't know, it won't be real
(how could you know?)
No, it won't be real
(how could you know?)
Won't know how it feels

Till it happens to you
Happens to you
Happens to you
Happens to you
Happens to you
Happens to you
(how could you know?)
Till it happens to you
You won't know how I feel
