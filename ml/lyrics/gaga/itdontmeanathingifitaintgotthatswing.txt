It don't mean a thing if it ain't got that swing
(Doo-wah, doo-wah, doo-wah, doo-wah,
Doo-wah, doo-wah, doo-wah, doo-wah)
It don't mean a thing, all you got to do is sing
(Doo-wah, doo-wah, doo-wah, doo-wah,
Doo-wah, doo-wah, doo-wah, doo-wah)
It makes no diff'rence if it's sweet or it's hot
Just give that rhythm ev'rything you got
Oh, it don't mean a thing if it ain't got that swing
(Doo-wah, doo-wah, doo-wah, doo-wah,
Doo-wah, doo-wah, doo-wah, doo-wah)

It makes no diff'rence if it's sweet or it's hot
Just give that rhythm ev'rything you got
Oh, it don't mean a thing if it ain't got that swing
(Doo-wah, doo-wah, doo-wah, doo-wah,
Doo-wah, doo-wah, doo-wah, doo-wah)
(Doo-wah, doo-wah, doo-wah, doo-wah,
Doo-wah, doo-wah, doo-wah, doo-wah)
(Doo-wah, doo-wah, doo-wah, doo-wah,
Doo-wah, doo-wah, doo-wah, doo-wah)
