Love is just a history that they may prove
And when you're gone I'll tell them my religion's you

When Pontius comes to kill the king upon his throne
I'm ready for their stones

I'll dance, dance, dance
With my hands, hands, hands
Above my head, head, head
Like Jesus said
I'm gonna dance, dance, dance
With my hands, hands
Hands above my head
Hands together
Forgive him before he's dead Because

I won't cry for you
I won't crucify the things you do
I won't cry for you, see
When you're gone I'll still be bloody Mary

We are not just art for Michelangelo
To carve. He can't rewrite the agro of my furied heart
I'll wait on mountain tops in Paris cold
Je ne veux pas mourir tout seule 
I'll dance, dance, dance
With my hands, hands, hands
Above my head, head, head
Like Jesus, said
I'm gonna dance, dance, dance
With my hands, hands
Hands above my head
Dance together
Forgive him before he's dead Because

I won't cry for you
I won't crucify the things you do
I won't cry for you, see
When you're gone I'll still be bloody Mar

Gaga, Gaga, Gaga, Gaga, Gaga, Gaga, Gaga, Gaga
Dum dum da da da
Dum dum da da da da da da
Dum dum da da da
Dum dum da da da da da da

Dum dum da da da

I won't cry for you
I won't crucify the things you do do do
I won't cry for you (Gaga), see
When you're gone (Gaga) I'll still be Bloody Mary
Gaga
Whoah Whoah Whoah, Whoah Whoah Whoah, Whoah Whoah Whoah
Whoah Whoah Whoah, Whoah Whoah Whoah

Oh, libérate mi amor
