standing in a queue of a school canteen
guys on the corner they were laughin' at me
but i don't mind if they see it all
you know i gotta come clean
i gotta come clean
i got a crush on you

my mind don't need it but my body do
a little bit of loving and attention for you
although we're only strangers
they don't need to know
i gotta cum clean, i gotta cum clean
ooh, i got a crush on you

i wanna get serious right away
1-2, i got a crush on you
what you doin' today or any other day?
1-2, i got a crush on you
just one look and i go insane
1-2, i got a crush on you

your daddy never comes to get you
`cos lives so far away
but his i-talian chauffeur shows up every day
but i'll get you in the corner, i'll get you all
alone
i gotta cum clean, i gotta come clean

i got a crush on you

1-2, i got a crush on you
1-2, i got a crush on you
1-2, i got a crush on you
i said 1-2
i got a crush on you

why should i get a crush on yet?
