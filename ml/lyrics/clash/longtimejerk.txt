Gonna scrape the trouble off my boots!

As they were dancing in the evening
And the light shone through the trees
This girl my eye was following
Asked the band to play her a beat

Singin' she'd do that long time jerk
She hit me where it hurts
Ohhh your heart
Now my heart will burst
Oh no

Ah, but it took me back to that  wonderland
I witnessed long ago
Babbling words of preachers
Sayin'- &quot;Don't bury me no more&quot;

Ohh...

And I've forgotten how to worry
And I don't know how to run
Against the odds I realize
This struggle could be won!

We dance

Long time jerk
She did it to me first
Ohhh my heart
With that long time jerk

Ah! Say..... Do that long time jerk.

Bring on those tapes from the past
They make you look better in a mirror
Feel that long time jerkin'
Between the taker and the giver

Feel that...

Long time jerk
She hit me where it hurts
Oh I felt my heart
Now my heart will burst

I've forgotten how to worry
And I don't know how to run
Against the odds I realize
This struggle could be fun!

Oh, through lanes and streets and houses
And reversing rush of time
She made me re-invent the world
Before inventing time
(Before inventing time)

Long time jerk
Oh, she hit me where it hurts
Ohhhhh my heart
Long time jerk

Long, long, long, long, long
Long time
Long time jerk
