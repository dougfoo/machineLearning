Ow, come here boy

I met a drummer last week
at a pool bar down b-by the shore
With a body like that and your stonewashed eyes 
I want you more

He cried, &quot;Mother! What'd you do to me?&quot;
I said, &quot;Mother mother mother's for babies
Call me kitty.&quot;

Yeah

Shake your kitty
Shake your kitty (meow)
Put your arms around me, babe
I'm giving you permission to feel me

Shake your kitty
Shake your kitty (meow)
Put your arms around me, babe
I'm giving you permission to feel me

Shake your shake
Shake shake 
Shake your sh-shake
Shake it, shake it
Shake it, shake it
Shake it, shake

I took a drummer by the hand
To the Juke box then
We hit the floor
With your Van Halen pin
And your dark side burns
I want you more

He cried, &quot;Mother! What'd you do to me?&quot;
I said, &quot;Mother mother mother's for babies
Call me kitty.&quot;

Oh, why dontcha

Shake your kitty
Shake your kitty (meow)
Put your arms around me, babe
I'm giving you permission to feel me

Shake your kitty
Shake your kitty (meow)
Put your arms around me, babe
I'm giving you permission to feel me

You never call me by my name
But I still want you
You play some pretty tricky games
But I still want you
Your best friend drives a fancy car
But I still want you
You're working every hour 
But, but I still want you yeah!

If you see a girl this pretty
Shake her, shake her, shake her kitty
When you see a girl that's pretty
Shake it, shake it, shake that kitty

Shake your kitty (meow)
Put your arms around me, babe
I'm giving you permission to feel me

Shake your kitty
Why don't you
Shake your kitty (meow)
Put your arms around me, babe
I'm giving you permission to feel me

When you see a girl this pretty
Shake her, shake her, shake her kitty
When you see a girl that's pretty
Shake your, shake your, shake that kitty

Shake your shake
Shake it, shake it
Shake it, shake it
Shake it, shake
Meowwww
