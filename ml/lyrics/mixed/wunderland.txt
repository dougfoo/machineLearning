No good boys ever go to heaven
But it's loving wunderland
Open mouth kiss and we dance
I can't believe, can't believe that I met you

Pink champagne 
Merry round spinning round again
In this wunderland where I met you

1234567
Hold your breath count to 11
Bodies moving wunderland
Open mouth kiss and we dance
I can't believe, can't believe how I met you

So DJ play
Let the record spin again
In this wunderland where I met you

Talk to me baby
Talk to me baby
Talk to me baby

Talk to me baby
Take my hand 
Talk to me baby
I got plans
