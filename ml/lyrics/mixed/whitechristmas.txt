I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
Just like the one I used to know
Where the tree tops glisten and children listen
To hear sleigh bells in the snow, oh oh oh oh oh oh

I'm dreaming of a white, white, white Christmas
With every Christmas card I write

Oh ьay your days be so very merry and bright
And may all your Christmases be white



I'm dreaming of a white Snowman
With the carrot nose and charcoal eyes
And oh when he cries I'm gonna tell him
It's okay
Because Santa's on his sleigh and on his way

I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
With every Christmas card I write
So may your days and Thanksgiving be so bright
And may all your Christmases be white
