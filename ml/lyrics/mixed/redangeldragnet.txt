I come from a long way away
And I know a fine thing when I see it.
See it
For the same reason no one ever
Pointed a telescope at the sun
Talking about the Red Angels of New York City


Who shot the shot?
Who got shot tonite?

Not even five enforcement agencies can save their own.
Never mind the people
Tonite it's raining on the Angels of the City
Did anyone prophesize these people?

Only Travis
Come in Travis
One of these days I'm gonna get myself organized.

All the animals come out at night.
Queens, fairies, dopers, junkies, sick venal.
Some day a real rain will come and wash all the scum off the streets.

Thank god for the rain to wash the trash off the sidewalk. Listen you screwheads:
Here is a man who would not take it anymore.
A man who stood up against the scum, the filth.
Now I see clearly.

Personally I know the alley
Where Jack feeds on the birds of night
Not even bubbies on bicycles 2x2
Can stop the blood and feathers flying

Waring overalls and for once and for all
What is the dream?
I'll tell it
To live like they do in the movies
San Juan you listening?

Yeah I bet you are
Hands up for Hollywood
Hooray
I hear you
Snappy on the air
Hang in their
Wall to wall
You saved the worled
What else? You saved the girl
Chmpagne on ice
No stranger to Alcatraz
To boot
Or strip it down
Chop it a little
Being reasonable
Just freedom to move
To live
For women to take a walk in the park at midnite
Hey, but this is serious
She can't even get back home

I come from a long way off
And I know a lifegiver over a lifetaker
For the same reason no-one ever pointed
A gun at a policeman
Talking about the Red Angels of New York City
Yeah
