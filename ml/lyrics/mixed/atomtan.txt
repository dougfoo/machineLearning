Now the corporations stopped!
Stopped pushing fast food
Been a multiple shooting
Downtown at the bank
Reluctantly the panic begins
To catch fire
But it did not affect
The steady sale of jun
The state office looked
It looked like Hollywood
With make-up bleeding all over the cracks
Wo he blew his lines
Facing the cameras
He suffered the first


All live heart attack
Oh you've caught an even atom tan

The motor-cyanide
Cyanide suicide
He finally found the brick wall in his life
Shining up his engine
He dressed right up for it
At the top of the speedo
He crumpled the bike
There's plenty people runnin' runnin' for cover-
Hoping at best to hold off al the rest
Once last stand at the bunker fire
Machine gun and pitchfork at breast



But it isn't so easy
So easy for lovers
Chained in love
Stained at the top of the tower
The pink hearse is leaving at funeral speed
Driving your heart
Away with the flowers
All night I waited
I waited for a horseman
His ever faithful
His Indian friend
I'm not the only one
Of the caped crusader fan club watching the sky
For mankind's friend



Oh you've caught an even atom tan
Calamine
