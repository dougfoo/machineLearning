Wait, I think it's time 
Your fire's lit and so is mine 
Go turn out the light 
Don't be afraid, tonight's the night 

And I won't, I won't try to change you 
But I will, I will if I want to 
Yeah, it always brings me down 
When you're not around 
I still need you 

Oh, You do something for me baby 
I cannot control it, baby 
You do something for me 
Oh, You do something crazy to me 
I cannot control it, baby 
You do something for me 

And I feel so down 
When you're not around 

Boy, we're almost there 
I'll lay your clothes over my chair 
Pull the shades down low 
We're both ready so lose control 

And I won't, I won't try to tame you 
But I will, I will if you want to 
Yeah it always brings me down 
When you're not around 
I still need you 

Oh, You do something for me baby 
I cannot control it, baby 
You do something for me 
Oh, You do something crazy to me 
I cannot control it, baby 
You do something for me 

And I feel so down 
When you're not around 

And I won't, I won't try to tame you 
But I will, I will if you want to 
Yeah it always brings me down 
When you're not around 
I still need you 

Oh, You do something for me baby 
I cannot control it lately 
You do something for me 
Oh, You do something for me baby 
I cannot control it lately 
You do something for me 

Oh, You do something crazy to me 
I cannot control it, baby 
La la la la la la la la 
You always bring me down
