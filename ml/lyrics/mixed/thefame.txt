I can't help myself I'm addicted to a life of 
material 
It's some kind of joke, I'm obsessively 
opposed to the typical 
All we care about is, runway models, cadillacs 
and liquor bottles 
Give me something I wanna be, retro glamour, 
Hollywood yes we live for the 

Fame 
Doin' it for the 
Fame 
Cuz we wanna live the life of the rich and 
famous 
Fame 
Doin' it for the 
Fame 
Cuz we gotta taste for champagne and endless 
fortune 

Fame fame baby 
The fame fame 
We live for the fame fame baby 
The fame fame 
Isn't it a shame shame baby 
A shame shame 
In it for the fame fame baby 
The fame fame 

I can see myself in the movies with my 
picture in the city lights 
Photograph my mind and whatever else you'd 
like to shoot you decide 
All we care about is, pornographic girlson film 
and body plastic 
Give me something, I wanna see television and 
hot blondes in odd positions 

Fame 
Doin' it for the 
Fame 
Cuz we wanna live the life of the rich and 
famous 
Fame 
Doin' it for the 
Fame 
Cuz we gotta taste for champagne and endless 
fortune 

Fame fame baby 
The fame fame 
We live for the fame fame baby 
The fame fame 
Isn't it a shame shame baby 
A shame shame 
In it for the fame fame baby 
The fame fame 

Don't ask me how or why 
But I'm gonna make it happen this time 
My teenage dream tonight 
Yeah I'm gonna make it happen this time 

Fame! 
Fame 
Doin it for the fame 
Cuz we wanna live the life of the rich and 
famous 

Fame 
Doin' it for the 
Fame 
Cuz we wanna live the life of the rich and 
famous 
Fame 
Doin' it for the 
Fame 
Cuz we gotta taste for champagne and endless 
fortune 

Fame 
Doin' it for the 
Fame 
Cuz we wanna live the life of the rich and 

famous 
Fame 
Doin' it for the 
Fame 
Cuz we gotta taste for champagne and endless 
fortune
