In your brown eyes, walked away
In your brown eyes, couldn't stay
In your brown eyes, you watch her go

And turn the record on
And wonder what went wrong
What went wrong

If everything was everything
But everything is over
Everything could be everything
If only we were older

Guess it's just a silly song about you
And how I lost you
And your brown eyes

In your brown eyes, I was feeling low
'cause they're brown eyes and you never know
Got some brown eyes, but I saw her face

I knew that it was wrong
So baby, turn the record on
Play that song

Where everything was everything
But everything is over
Everything could be everything
If only we were older

Guess it's just a silly song about you
And how I lost you
And your brown eyes

Everything was everything
But baby it's the last show
Everything could be everything
But it's time to say goodbye so
Get your last fix, and your last hit
Grab your old girl with her new tricks

Honey yeah, it's no surprise
I got lost in your brown eyes

In your brown eyes
Brown, brown eyes
Your brown eyes
Brown, brown eyes
Got some brown eyes
Brown, brown eyes
Your brown eyes
