Face down in a pillow, she cries
Her black mascara runs in circles from her-er-er eyes
Pink feather regrets she washes away
She said she wants him
But it's hurtin' and it's burnin' him the worst
The worst way

She does the yay ha
Yay, yay, yay, yay ha
Let's do the yay ha
Yay, yay, yay, yay ha

Luck down in a bathroom, she cries
Her white skin looks better in this kind of light
Pink feather regrets she washes away
Looks in her mirror
And it's hurtin' and it's burnin' in the worst
The worst way

She does the yay ha
Yay, yay, yay, yay ha
Let's do the yay ha
Yay, yay, yay, yay ha

She does the yay ha
Yay, yay, yay, yay ha
Let's do the yay ha
Yay, yay, yay, yay ha

Face down in a pillow, she cries
Her black mascara runs in circles from her-er-er eyes

She says she loves to run
Her hands are tongue tied
He said, its just a game
Then why do we play

Ya ha
She says she loves to run
Yay ha
Her hands are tongue tied
Ya ha
Yay, yay, yay, yay ha
Then why do we play
...
