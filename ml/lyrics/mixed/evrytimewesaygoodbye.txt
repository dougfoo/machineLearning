We love each other so deeply
That I ask you this, sweetheart,
Why should we quarrel ever,
Why can't we be enough clever,
Never to part.

Ev'ry time we say goodbye
I die a little,
Ev'ry time we say goodbye
I wonder why a little,
Why the gods above me
Who must be in the know
Think so little of me
They allow you to go.

When you're near
There's such an air
Of spring about it,
I can hear a lark somewhere
Begin to sing about it,
There's no love song finer,
But how strange the change
From major to minor...
Ev'ry time we say goodbye.
Ev'ry time we say goodbye.
