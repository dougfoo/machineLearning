There it feels like a remix, yeah
Feel like a remix, yeah
It must be the remix, yeah
(Lady Gaga, Rick Ross)
Oooh, oooh
(It's special right here)
Got to feel the remix, yeah
(You're so special right here)
Oooooooooooooh

Photos of the boss
He just post 'em on a blog
Get a lotta views
Cause they know we be the top
Jean Basquiat's
In the middle of our hall
Ooh, she's my work of art
So I pin her to the wall
Oh oh, sex and the dope
Underneath the waterfall
Sight seeing in a space jet
As I be paying off the stores
Ain't me understated
I've got to tag it on your wall
Cause under art has crossed the border
Cause got together
Mouthing in the middle
Hanging out the moon
Bruce Willis on the pillow
Hot, pull on a glove
Black bottle for a model
Oh, I gotta keep a follow
Crazy girls on the model
Boss

I, I feel good, I walk alone
But then I trip upon myself and I fall
I, I stand up, and then I'm okay
But then you print some shit
That makes me wanna scream

So do what u want
What u want with my body
Do what u want
Don't stop, let's party
Do what u want
What u want with my body
Do what u want
What you want with my body

Write what u want
Say what u want 'bout me
If you're wonderin'
Know that I'm not sorry

Do what u want
What u want with my body
What u want with my body

You can't have my heart
And you won’t use my mind but
Do what u want (with my body)
Do what u want with my body
You can't stop my voice cause
You don't own my life but
Do what u want (with my body)
Do what u want (with my body)

Early morning, longer nights
Tom Ford, private flights
Crazy schedule, fast life
I wouldn't trade it in
'Cause it's our life
(Let's slow it down)

I could be the drink in your cup
I could be the green in your blunt
Your pusher man, yea I got what you want
You wanna escape all of the crazy shit
You're the Marilyn, I'm the president
And I love to hear you sing, girl

Do what I want
Do what I want with your body
Do what I want
Do what I want with your body
Back of the club, takin' shots, gettin' naughty
No invitations, it's a private party
Do what I want
Do what I want with your body
Do what I want
Do what I want with your body
Yea we takin' these haters 
And we roughin' 'em up
And we layin' the club like 
We don't give a fuck

You can't have my heart
And you won’t use my mind but
Do what u want (with my body)
Do what u want with my body
You can't stop my voice cause
You don't own my life but
Do what u want (with my body)
Do what u want (with my body)

Sometimes I'm scared I suppose
If you ever let me go
I would fall apart
If you break my heart
So just take my body
And don't stop the party

You can't have my heart (Help me now)
And you won’t use my mind but
Do what u want (with my body)
Do what u want with my body
You can't stop my voice cause
You don't own my life but
Do what u want (with my body)
Do what u want (with my body)

Do what you want with me
What you want with my body
Do what you want with me
What you want with my body (boy)
Do what you want with me
What you want with my body
Do what you want with me
What you want with my body, world

Help me now 
(What you want with my body)
Do what you want with my body
Do what you want with my body
(What you want my body, world)
(What you want with my body)
