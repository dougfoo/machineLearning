Hush up, don't speak, don't wanna hear another (not another word from you)
You're just an ani-mal trying to act real special (but deep down you are just a shrew)

Maybe I should have a little more just to stay out of my mind
'Cause it's when I'm not thinking with you that I act like a swine!
Act like a swine! Act like a swine!


I know, I know, I know, I know you want me
You're just a pig inside a human body
Squealer, squealer, squealer, you're so disgusting
You're just a pig inside...
Do you? I know, I know, I know you want me
You're just a pig inside a human body
Squealer, squealer, squealer, you're so disgusting
You're just a pig inside...

SWINE! 



Swine! 


Be that hog sweat it out, you squealer? (let your body jiggle)
Slap her skin–he love to watch her ass go wiggle (it's the feel of ecstasy)

Maybe I should have a little more just to stay out of my mind
'Cause it's when I'm not thinking with you that I act like a swine!
Act like a swine! Act like a swine!



SWINE! 




Paint your face and
Paint his face and
(Catch the beat)
Paint your face and
Paint her face and
(Catch the beat)
Paint your face and
Be a swine just
(Catch the beat)
For the weekend
(Catch the beat) 
Swine!
