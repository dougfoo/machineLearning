Take my hand, stay Joanne
Heaven's not
Ready for you
Every part
Of my aching heart
Needs you more
Than the angels do

Girl
Where do you think you're goin'?
Where do you think you're goin'?
Goin', girl?
Girl
Where do you think you're goin'?
Where do you think you're goin'?
Goin', girl?

If you could
I know that you'd stay
We both know
Things don't work that way
I promised I
Wouldn't say goodbye
So I grin
And my voice gets thin

Girl
Where do you think you're goin'?
Where do you think you're goin'?
Goin', girl?
Girl
Where do you think you're goin'?
Where do you think you're goin'?
Goin', girl?

Honestly, I know where you're goin'
And baby, you're just movin' on
And I'll still love you even if I can't
See you anymore
Can't wait to see you soar

Girl
Where do you think you're goin'?
Where do you think you're goin'?
Goin', girl?
Girl
Where do you think you're goin'?
Where do you think you're goin'?
Goin', girl?

Call me Joanne
XO, Joanne
XOXO, Joanne
