This is Radio Clash
Stealing all transmissions
Beaming from the mountaintop
Using aural ammunition

With extreme prejudice
On a terminator mission
This is Radio Clash
Consider your position

Step it up, get down low

Breaking news flash
Assassination
The whole country has been shot

Evil will abate
In Revelation
In the Ministry of Whitewash

Wait, wait
Don't switch off the death
Yes, we have the latest score
Rebel Islanders: 101 and Home Yard: 44

This is Radio Clash

Sharper than a sword

And in the thundercloud

Even angels were in hell on the morning of the sixth

Like buckets of venom in (????)
They've got a master plan
Human wars over there

Gets a job in the dirty old town

Gets a job in the dirty old town

This is not free
This is not free Europe
No, no, no, no, no
Nor an armed force network

This is Radio Clash
Stealing all transmission
Beaming from the mountaintop
Aural ammunition

A riggy diggy dig dang dang

This is Radio Clash
Stealing information
By his will as a (???)
Use careful confirmation

Bribery, extortion
Legal legislation
Security is life indeed
Accept no other explanation

This is Radio Clash
On pirate satellite
Orbiting your living room
Everybody hold on tight
