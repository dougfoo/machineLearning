If you ain't reggae for it..funk out!
No-one knocking at your door?
Overpowered by funk? Funk out!

Combatative, repetitive
Don't life just funk you out?
Asanine, stupifying
Can the clone line dry you out?

Part of the swarming mass? Funk out!
Slugged by the new increase?
Scared of the human bomb?
Overpowered by funk? Funk out!

Buy dog food
Rogue elephants
Tarzan on a ticker tape
Breakfast, serials?
You know you can't escape

Overpowered by funk
Don't you love our Western ways?
Car crashed by funk
Don't you love our Western ways?

Benny Goodman, trial by jury
A phone box-full of books
Dustcarts and sunrise
No-one gets off the hooks car crashed...
Food for the hungry millions? Funk out!
Home for the floating people?
Skin for the napalm victim?
Overdrunk on power
Funk out!

The final game will be solitaire
Overdrunk on power...funk out

Picture frame, tickets here
For the graffiti train
People at home show you care
Don't try
Fry me in your shockin' chairs
Funkpower over and out

This is a message from Futura
Don't prophisize the future
I liven up the culture
Because I'm deadly as a vulture
I paint on civilization
It's environmentally wack
So presenting my attack
I'll brighten up your shack
I'm down by law
That's a fact
Just give me a wall.
Any building dull or tall
I spray clandestine night subway
I cover red purple on top of grey
Hey, no slashing cuz it ain't the way
The T.A. blew 40 mil they say
We thew down by night
They scrubbed it off by day
OK tourists
