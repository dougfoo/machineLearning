Baby you've got a lot of questions
You better listen up please
I wanna know what you want and need
To charge up your batteries

You got the flow and the intention
Boy but have you got the mouth
(got the mouth, got the mouth)
Show me that you got the ammunition
That you're good for a while
for a while, for a  while

Charge it up because ba-by you could be mine
I don't need a red solider
I need you to reload it 
Bring it reloaded

Charge it up cause babe you're one of a kind
I don't need a red solider
I need you to reload it 
Bring it reloaded

You had better rest up your energy
You better reserve yourself
Cause tonight I'm expecting to get plenty
And I won't do it myself

Conserve your juices cause I'm gonna
take you on a merry-go
I'm not ridiculous I'm just a girl
Who likes a man who can't go wrong
can't go wrong can't go wrong

Charge it up because ba-by you could be mine
I don't need a red solider
I need you to reload it 
Bring it reloaded

Charge it up cause babe you're one of a kind
I don't need a red solider
I need you to reload it 
Bring it reloaded

I doubt I'm gonna do ya right
And i won't complain if you're buggin
Cant handle my lovin'
