I can't give you anything but love, baby
That's the only thing I've plenty of, baby
Dream a while, scheme a while you're sure to find
Happiness and I guess all those things you've always pined for

Gee, I like to see you looking swell, tony with
Diamond watches, Tiffany's just don't sell, baby
Till the lucky day you know darn well
Oh I can't give you anything but love.


I can't give you anything but love, lady
That's the only thing I've plenty of, lady
Dream awhile, scheme a while, you're sure to find
Happiness and I guess all those things you've always pined for
How you like to see me looking swell? lady
Diamond bracelets, Woolworth doesn't sell, Gaga


Till the lucky day you know darn well, baby
Oh I can't give you anything, I don't want just anything
Oh I can't give you anything but love
