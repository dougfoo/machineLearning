Sometimes a story has no end
Sometimes I think that we could just be friends
&quot;'Cause I'm a wandering man, &quot; he said to me.

And what about our future plans?
Does this thing we have even make sense?
When I got the whole world in front of me

So I said, &quot;I don't wanna be alone forever.
But I can be tonight
I don't wanna be alone forever
But I love gypsy life
I don't wanna be alone forever
Maybe we can see the world together
I don't wanna be alone forever
But I can be tonight, tonight.&quot;

So I just packed my baggage and
Said goodbye to family and friends
And took the road to nowhere on my own

Like Dorothy on a yellow brick
Hope my ruby shoes get us there quick
'Cause I left everyone I love at home

And I don't wanna be alone forever
But I can be tonight
I don't wanna be alone forever
But I love gypsy life
I don't wanna be alone forever
Maybe we can see the world together
I don't wanna be alone forever
But I can be tonight, tonight

'Cause I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm
A gypsy, gypsy, gypsy, I'm
I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm
A gypsy, gypsy, gypsy, I'm
I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm
A gypsy, gypsy, gypsy, I'm
I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm
A gypsy, gypsy, gypsy, I'm

And then he asked me,
He said, &quot;Baby, why do we love each other?&quot;
I said, &quot;Honey, it's simple.
It's the way that you love and treat your mother.&quot;

Thought that I would be alone forever
But I won't be tonight
I'm a man without a home
But I think with you I can spend my life
And you'll be my little gypsy princess
Pack your bags and we can chase the sunset
Bust the rearview and fire up the jets
'Cause it's you and me
Baby, for life

Would you go with me?
(Tonight)
See the world with me

'Cause I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm
A gypsy, gypsy, gypsy, I'm
I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm
A gypsy, gypsy, gypsy, I'm

Russia, UK, Paris, I'm
Italian, Asian, Kompai
Africa, India, I'm
A gypsy, a gypsy, a gypsy. I'm
Latin American, I don't speak German but I try
Someday in Jakarta, I'm
American, I'm gypsy I
Bangkok, Australia, Malaysia
Sweden, Finland, Norway
Be my home just for the day
I'm a gypsy, gypsy, gypsy hey
