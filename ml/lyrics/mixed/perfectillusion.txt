Tryin' to keep control
Pressure's takin' its toll
Stuck in the middle zone
I just want you alone
My guessing game is strong
Way too real to be wrong
Caught up in your show
Yeah, at least now I know

It wasn't love, it wasn't love
It was a perfect illusion (perfect illusion)
Mistaken for love, it wasn't love
It was a perfect illusion (perfect illusion)

Oh
You were a perfect illusion

I don't need eyes to see
I felt you touchin' me
High like amphetamine
Maybe you're just a dream
That's what it means to crush
Now that I'm wakin' up
I still feel the blow
But at least now I know

It wasn't love, it wasn't love
It was a perfect illusion (perfect illusion)
Mistaken for love, it wasn't love
It was a perfect illusion (perfect illusion)

Where are you?
'Cause I can't see (it was a perfect illusion)
But I feel you watchin' me
Dilated, falling free
In a modern ecstasy

Where are you?
'Cause I can't see (it was a perfect illusion)
But I feel you watchin' me
But I feel you watchin' me (illusion)
But I feel you watchin' me (mistaken for love)

Where were you?
'Cause I can't see
But I feel you watchin' me (mistaken for love)
Dilated, falling free
In a modern ecstasy (mistaken for love)
In a modern ecstasy
In a modern ecstasy

I'm over the show
Yeah, at least now I know

It wasn't love, it wasn't love
It was a perfect illusion (perfect illusion)
Mistaken for love, it wasn't love
It was a perfect illusion (perfect illusion)

Oh
You were a perfect illusion
Oh
It was a perfect illusion

It was a perfect illusion
Somewhere in all the confusion
It was a perfect illusion, illusion, illusion

It was a perfect illusion
Somewhere in all the confusion
You were so perfect
You were a—you were a perfect illusion
