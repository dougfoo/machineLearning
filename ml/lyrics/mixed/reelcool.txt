Hey there, weatherman

Put your hands together for the pony scene
There’s a boat with a sail and some real whip cream
Ladies on the winning team
Yeah, all the boys karaoke scream

Ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah
Ah ah ah ah ooh ooh
Reel cool

Put your cute thing out of my flow, joke
Baby, watch yourself and the records and no
We don’t mess around when it comes to being fabulous
We are reel cool
Keep it reel cool
