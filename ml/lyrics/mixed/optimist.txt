It's over, 
It's over. 

You're like the definition of negative 
Always complainin, you're such a pessimist 
Your Cup is always half empty 
I'm just so sick of it 
I got a different perspective 

My Cup is half full 
My Sky is never gray 
You cant bring be down anymore baby 
My future is bright 
Cant wait to face the day 
There's one thing you should know about me 

I'm an optimist 
I'm so positive 
You'll never get another chance with me baby 
I'm an optimist 
I'm so positive 
Your chances blown, boy you're gone, with your negativity. 

(I'm an optimist, op-optimist, op-optimist) 

You're such a downer, You're never satisfied 
Lucky for me, there's always a silver line 
On the horizon, so boy don't even try 
Injectin me with your negative vibes 

My cup is half full 
My sky is never gray 
You cant bring be down anymore baby 
My future is bright 
Can't wait to face the day 
There's one thing you should know about me 

I'm an optimist 
I'm so positive 
You'll never get another chance with me baby 
I'm an optimist 
I'm so positive 
Your chances blown, boy you're gone, with your negativity. 

I'm an optimist. 
I'm spontaneous. 
I need fun and excitement, ready set. 
Here I come, Take the world by storm. 
Grab life by the horns, While I'm still young. 
And If you wanna act old, If you wanna be cold. 
Hmmm, I guess but baby you should know oh, oh, oh, oh 

I'm an optimist 
I'm so positive 
You'll never get another chance with me baby 
I'm an optimist 
I'm so positive 
Your chances blown, boy you're gone, with your negativity. 

I'm an optimist, op-optimist, op-optimist 
I'm a--I'm a-a-I'm-a-I'm an optimist 

I'm an optimist 
I'm so positive 
You'll never get another chance with me baby 
I'm an optimist 
I'm so positive 
Your chances blown, boy you're gone, with your negativity. 

I'm an optimist, op-optimist, op-optimist 
I'm a--I'm a-a-I'm-a-I'm an optimist
